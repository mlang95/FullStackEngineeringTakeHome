This code uses the datetime, nltk, and prettytable packages. Make sure you have those installed.

This code will first ask you if you want to have random data populated with, as an example. 
Then, it will take you a menu screen, where you can navigate through various options that will allow you to:
add a new policy holder, report claims to existing policy holders, give a list of general information with respect to our policyholders,
lookup claims by the policyholders unique ID, and give some basic aggregated data.

There is some data validation, however, due to time restrictions I was not able to incorporate many normalizations and data validation tools.

Thanks for taking the time to review my work, and I hope you enjoy!

Cheers,
